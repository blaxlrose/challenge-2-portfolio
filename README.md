# challenge-2-portfolio

## Welcome to my portfolio!

### For this challenge, I needed to make a portfolio page highlighting my finished projects as a new developer to a possible employer. I provided examples of my finished projects using flexboxes.I also provided links to all of my pertinent information. I made a responsive page that will look fairly good on many devices.
